Lifecycle Methods

4 Phases:
  Mounting : When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
             4 methods : constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render and componentDidMount
  Updating : When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
             5 methods : static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate
  Unmounting : When a component is being removed from the DOM
             1 method : componentWillUnmount
  Error Handling : When there is an error during rendering, in a Lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
             2 methods : static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch
